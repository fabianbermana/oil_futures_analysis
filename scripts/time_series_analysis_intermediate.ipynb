    "Now that we have estimated ARMA models using our oil price futures, we look at more advanced time series models. In the time_series_analysis_basic notebook, we observed that the residuals of the individual oil futures prices do not have homoskedastic residuals. This motivates the use of (G)ARCH models, which are used to model time series with time-varying volatility and volatility clustering. "

    "The ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model uses an AR model for errors, while the GARCH (Generalized ARCH) model uses an ARMA model of these errors. To jointly model the level of the time series $\\{y_t\\}^T_{t=1}$, along with its time-varying volatility $\\sigma_t^2$, we specify the mixed ARMA-GARCH model as:\n",

Parameters $\\alpha_i$ capture the impact of past squared errors, while parameters $\\beta_i$ represent the persistence of volatility over time. Typically, $z_t$ follows $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, but alternatives such as the t-distribution may also be used to model heavy tails."
