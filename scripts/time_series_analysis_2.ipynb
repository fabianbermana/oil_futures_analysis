    "Now that we have estimated ARMA models using our oil price futures, we look at more advanced time series models. In the time_series_analysis_1 notebook, we observed that the residuals of the individual oil futures prices do not have homoskedastic residuals. This motivates the use of (G)ARCH models, which are used to model time series with time-varying volatility and volatility clustering. "
